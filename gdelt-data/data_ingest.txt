### Commands for ingesting News Archive data.
# I copied and pasted these commands into terminal after modifying them here.

# The date range is 2016-01-10 to 2020-07-06.
# The wget command was modified to pull in different date ranges, e.g., 2016{01..12}{01..31}
# to keep the amount of files manageable, then I called the subsequent commands and repeated
# the wget command for the next range of values.

# Copy to local directory in DUMBO.
wget http://data.gdeltproject.org/gdeltv3/iatv/ngrams/20{16..20}{01..12}{01..31}.FOXNEWS.2gram.txt.gz

# Transfer to HDFS.
hdfs dfs -put *.gz /user/crb616/rbda_proj/fox_news

# Unzip in HDFS. I modified the range in this bash script similar to the wget command above.
./unzip-files.sh

# Throughout the process I spot checked the unzip process by using head and tail
# to see that the files were properly unzipped and added.
# For example:

## These commands:
hdfs dfs -cat rbda_proj/fox_news/20160110.FOXNEWS.2gram.txt.gz | gunzip -d | head
hdfs dfs -cat rbda_proj/fox_news/20160131.FOXNEWS.2gram.txt.gz | gunzip -d | tail

## Should match these:
hdfs dfs -cat rbda_proj/fox_news/2016+01.txt | head
hdfs dfs -cat rbda_proj/fox_news/2016+01.txt | tail

# Clean-up local folder
# I called the unzip and rm commands then repeated wget for the next date range.
rm *.gz

# Clean-up HDFS .txt.gz files once all dates are done.
hdfs dfs -rm -r rbda_proj/fox_news/*.txt.gz
